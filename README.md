## Run the Application

This project can be run using Xcode. You can install it [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/).

First, you will need to clone or download this code onto your local machine.

### Google Firebase

Sign in to your [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and create a new **iOS project**. This is necessary for using Firebase services such as the Firestore Database. A .plist file will be generated that holds sensitive key-value pairs that must be placed inside the Xcode Project.

## Run the Application

Open Xcode on your MacOS device, and then open the Xcode Project that can be found in the downloaded/cloned GitHub repository. Select a destination (either a device simulator or a physical iOS device) to run the project. Run `⌘ + B` to build the project. Finally, run `⌘ + R` to run the project on the selected destination.
